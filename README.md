# Instance Builder

instance builder will works as a bridge between the workflow manager and the corresponding adapter, it will receive a bunch of instances to create/delete on a 'instances.create' and it will emit messages 'instance.create' to process them.

Once all of them are fully processed it will emit back a message 'instances.create.done' as confirmation or 'instances.create.error' in case something is broken
